# Week Six Challenge - Teams

Montgomery County is proud to announce it's new {sports} (you choose which) league for all children, and it's decided to hire you as it's full-stack developer! They want to create a website to display their current teams and each of the players in those teams.
They already have 3 teams (the Cicadas, The Blue Crabs and the Woodpeckers), each with 2 members.
They want everyone who visits their website to be able to see the team names and a button leading to their team Page.
The Team Page should display all team information, including Player names per team. Logged-in users/admin should also be able to see a button leading to each child's profile page, where their first name, last name, age, picture and team are displayed.

Each team should have at least:

- Name
- City
- Players

Only an admin, with the credentials username "admin", password "admin" (make sure you include these credentials) can register/update/delete a Team. Only an authenticated user (or an admin) can add in a new child and needs to provide a first name, last name, age, picture and the team the child will participate in. Include buttons for these pages (/addPlayer, /updateTeam, etc.) in your pages (preferably the navbar).

There should be a consistent navbar across all pages (Home page, team page, player page).



Done?

- Allow admins to update players.
- Add photos to each team
- Feeling good? --> Allow only the users who registered players (or the admin) to update players.
- Add a search bar so other kids can find their friends and see which team they belong to



Feeling super good ?
- How would you implement "trading" players from 1 team to the other? What about games between teams ?
